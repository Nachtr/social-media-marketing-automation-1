# social-media-marketing-automation-1
This lab focuses on building a python script to automate social media posts for a marketing company. I will work with lists, dictionaries, loops, and functions to generate customized posts for different products across multiple platforms.


# Overview
This is a project that was assigned as a lab through my SMU AI bootcamp. It was designed to reinforce python fundamentals through demonstrating some of the real-world applications of python. These goal was to build a script that automates social media post generation for a marketing company. Through this, I practed working with lists, dictionaries, loops, and more.

I iterated that this is the 1st in the title, because at a later date I want to come back and redo some of these to make them really efficient and actually demonstrate some of my more developed skills :).

# Features
